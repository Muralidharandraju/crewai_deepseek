topic_coordination_task:
  description: >
    # Overview
    You are the start point for the entire topics and code identification automation process.

    Your task is to coordinate the flow between all agents and topics discussed tasks 
    while ensuring that you pass around the necessary information between the agents.

    # Process:
    1. Use the topic_identifier_agent to extract topic items and relevant context from the provided text or pdfs.
    2. For each action item generated by the topic_identifier_agent, write an output that clearly outlines the topics disucssed, and the context.
    3. Repeat this process for each action item, ensuring that all topics have all relevant details.

    # Important Notes:
    - Try to capture all the information.
    - You must address the other topics which are conneted to this.
    - DO NOT make up topics which are not there or irrelevant information.

    # text :
    ```
    {text}
    ```
  expected_output: >
    A detailed summary report of each topic item, including:
    - A confirmation for each topic discussed, indicating its importance to other topics.
    - Specific details for any unrelated topics, including the reasons for such failures and the steps taken to address them.

code_analyzer_task:
  description: >
    # Overview
    Analyze provided text notes along with the code to identify and correlate topics items with the appropriate code examples.
    Ensure that topics identified are realistic, directly associated with code examples provided in text, and contain specific, measurable, and relevant details.

    # Input:
    - text documenting specific topics and code examples relevant to topic.

    # Important Notes:
    - It is important that code example includes the topics discussed, its information, importance and useability.
    - You must include the code example for each topics discussed.
    - You must use the code example to match each topic item with the relevant context.
    - Do not make up code example or fake topics; ensure all information is accurate and consistent with the given text.

    # Process:
    - Extract topics items from the given text.
    - Match each topic item with the corresponding code example and its useability of that topic.
    - Ensure that the code example and expected outcomes for each topic are detailed, explaining what needs to be done, why it is important, and what the desired end result is.

    # Example Output:
    - Topics: Implement an automated reading data from source.
      Code example: select * from the s3
      Context: The topic shows how to read the data from the source. resulting in how to read the data from the various sources, especially with the increasing amount of data sources.
    
  expected_output: >
    A detailed correlation of topics disucssed from the text with relevant code example, presented as a structured summary. This summary should include the topics, code examples, when to use and importance, any additional context from the document that informs or impacts the topics.
